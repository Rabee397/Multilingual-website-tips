-start your website with the default langauge (english , left to right) if you want your website to have 
more than the default.
-if you want to write the whole website (right to left) add dir="rtl" on html tag.
-if you want specific sentence to be written in it's main direction (for example Arabic sentence) in english direction
use <bdi> tag.
-if you want to insert Arabic words inside input elemnts (in english dir) use attribute dir="auto".
-try to use margin and padding on both (left and right).
-when it comes to icons that have directions like arrows it's better to write it with psuedo element.
